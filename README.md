Whatsapp, Messenger, SnapChat, there are tons of Chatting Websites these days. Chatting Websites uses a special kind of requests called "Web Sockets". Web Sockets helps to open a two-way interactive communication session between the user's browser and a server. I used the concept of web sockets and built a "Multi User Real-Time Online Chatting Application".
